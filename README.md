# sentiment-analysis

This aim of this project is to understand the sentiment polarity over the twitter data.
"dataset.txt" consist of twitter data fetched from live stream of twitter using twitter API, Hadoop 2.0
--> In "dataset.txt" we are having twitter posts in multiple language and some unstructured_text(noise)

"textBlobDemo.py" is just an example script used to detect different language and translate it to english.

"demo.txt" is the text file extracted after translating few messages of "dataset.txt" file to english using same method as "textBlobdemo.py"
script followed.

"sentiment analysis.py" is the main script used to conduct sentiment analysis and also do the data visualization(Histogram, WordCloud) of the twitter post.
